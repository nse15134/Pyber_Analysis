# Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to explore and analyze Fare trends ($) by city type as the year progresses.  We want to understand any areas of opportunity and increase the opportunity for affordability and access across 3 different city types.  We want to highlight and call out important metrics such as Total rides for each city type, Drivers by city type, Total fares by city type, and Average fare per driver.  These key metrics deal with both affordability and access and volume for the users.

We can see from above that the rural city type is in last place in both user to driver ratio as well as fares.  They are in last place in all fare categories.  Total fares is the lowest but fare by ride and fare by drvier are the highest of the 3 city types.  Urban was the best performing city type with the highest total of fares, as well as highest numbers of rides and drivers.
