# Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to explore and analyze Fare trends ($) by city type as the year progresses.  We want to understand any areas of opportunity and increase the opportunity for affordability and access across 3 different city types.  We want to highlight and call out important metrics such as Total rides for each city type, Drivers by city type, Total fares by city type, and Average fare per driver.  These key metrics deal with both affordability and access and volume for the users.

## Results

![Summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98061420/156940110-182b1898-471a-4cb0-ad18-631ab9a4379f.PNG)

We can see from above that the rural city type is in last place in both user to driver ratio as well as fares.  They are in last place in all fare categories.  Total fares is the lowest but fare by ride and fare by drvier are the highest of the 3 city types.  Urban was the best performing city type with the highest total of fares, as well as highest numbers of rides and drivers.

We can see from above that the data is fairly consistent for each city type as we roll through the year.  The order stays the same from January until April+. There are small variances here and there but we can clearly understand our best/middle/worst performing cities by both $ and counts.

## Summary
Unfortunately, the data involved in this challenge does not tell a full story to make a logical and data driven-recommendation to any ELT.  The Urban area is indeed lower performing in categories than its peers.  However, we need additional data points around % of populatuon that uses ride sharing apps, avg travel distances, socioeconomic indicators, etc.,  The assumption would be that ride-sharing apps are not the primary mode of transportation in those rural areas.  We would want to pull travel data from the 125 rides in the rural area to look at time, distance, frequency, and more. These advanced data points would allow us to make a more conclusive recommendation to management that will allow insights into if increasing investment in that area is impactful to the bottom line.
